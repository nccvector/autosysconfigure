# autosysconfigure

Auto system configuration using Bash, with all my favorite editors, terminals and their configs

#### IMPORTANT: Install nvidia-drivers using sudo apt nvidia-drivers-4xx, but dont install cuda toolkit using sudo apt. Instead, isntall cuda toolkit from nvidia website from .run file, and disable driver install/reinstall when you run the file.
